with code with library 
    there are actuaaly two inbuilt options are there :
        1) test_size
        2) train_size

test_size means that much percentage of data will go to test_size
train_size means that much percentage of data will go to train_size

like if you input split_size : 0.2 (let suppose total 100 rows) 
if test_size is the argument then in test_size 20 rows and train_size 80 rows (valid)
if train_size is the argument then in train_size 20 rows and test_size 80 rows(not valid)
